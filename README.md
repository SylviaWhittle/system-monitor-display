# system-monitor-display
Code for displaying Computer system statistics such as CPU usage and temperature through a 64x64 rgb matrix panel driven by a raspberry pi.

I make use of the rpi-rgb-led-matrix library found here: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix.  
I also make use of OpenHardwareMonitor to obtain the statistics for the system, found here: https://openhardwaremonitor.org/. 
Thank you to all those that maintain these software.
